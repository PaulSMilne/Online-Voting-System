# Programming & Web Fundamentals

Over the next week you have the chance to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

- Ruby fundamentals
- TDD
- OOP
- Web Programming ( REST/MVC )
- Databases with CRUD actions

Your assignment is an opportunity to practice all or some of these principles. Next Thursday you can do a short presentation on what you have achieved and learned.

We have created some briefs for you to choose from. However, if you have a web app idea that you are interested in creating let us know and we'll see if it's a viable option. 

Avoid trying to implment user logins! 

## Rockin' Rick's Music Store

The owner of Rockin' Rick’s Music Store, Rick, wants an app which will help him keep on top of his store inventory. He does not want an app that customers will see, but he will use to check stock levels and see what he needs to order soon.

You should be able to add stock, which would have an Artist and Album as well as the quantity available. He would ideally like:

- Inventory page
    - Show stock level of all items:
        - High/Medium/Low based on quantity
- Add albums
- Add artists
- Add stock

Any further analysis would be appreciated but not required, for example:

- Create route that sends down Inventory data as JSON
- Work out the markup for each product ( there could be a buy price and a sell price )
    - Total possible sales & markup on inventory page
- Search functionality on Inventory page
- Associated Genre (Rick associates one Genre to an Artist)

## MoneyCashboard

You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include merchant name e.g. Tesco and value ) which has an associated Tag (e.g. ‘food’). It would then be able to track a total. Your Account could then be displayed in a view.

Suggested MVP:

- Create new transactions
- Display all transactions
- Display total expenditure
- Display total expenditure by tag

Your app could:

- CRUD actions for the transations
- Create route that sends down Account data as JSON


## Animal Shelter

The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

Suggested MVP: 

 - A list of all their animals and their admission date
 - A list of all their animals that are adoptable
 - Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
 - Assign an animal to a new owner
 - List all the owners and their adopted animals

Further functionality could include:

 - Functionality to add and remove animals 
 - Functionality to add and remove owners
 - Analyse how long it takes for different types of animal to be trained

## Pub of the Year

The Edinburgh pub of the year vote is underway! The Campaign for Real Ale would like an administration website to track the votes for the best pub as voted by the pubs themselves. Unfortunately, it’s a postal ballot :( and CAMRA need to enter the results into a web based application.

The rules are:

 - Pubs can vote for other pubs but not themselves
 - Each pub has 3 votes to cast

As an MVP CAMRA would like to:

- Enter pubs into their database
- Enter the votes for each pub
- Display the results in a league table

Further functionality could include:

- Display a league table of areas with best pubs (Leith, Morningside, Marchmont, City Centre)
- A route that sends down the results data as JSON


## The 2018 Winter Olympics

The 2018 Winter Olympics are set to take place in South Korea! The organising body want you to help them out with an important feature for their website. They are looking for an app that will track the Nations, Athletes and results of Events.

They would like to make it possible to add an Athlete, which will have an associated Nation. Event results should keep track of the athlete who got gold, silver and bronze as well as the event they participated in.

As an MVP they would ideally like:

- Nation medal results table with
    - gold, silver and bronze count for each nation
    - total points for each nation based on:
        - 5 for Gold
        - 3 for Silver
        - 1 for Bronze
- Be able to add an Athlete, Nation and Event result.

Further functionality would be
- CRUD actions for Athlete, Nation and event results
- Listing of each event with the medalists
- Create route that sends down nation results data as JSON
